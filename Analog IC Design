ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Analog IC Design
Analog IC design involves creating integrated circuits that process real-world continuous signals such as sound, temperature, or voltage. Unlike digital circuits that deal with binary data, analog circuits focus on amplifying, filtering, and conditioning signals with high precision.

This field requires careful design of components like operational amplifiers, filters, biasing circuits, and voltage/current references, ensuring performance over process, voltage, and temperature variations. It plays a vital role in applications such as sensors, audio systems, power management, and communication interfaces.

Analog IC design combines circuit theory, semiconductor physics, and layout optimization, making it both challenging and essential for interfacing the physical world with digital system
